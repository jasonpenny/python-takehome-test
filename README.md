#Prediction

#### What?
* Write a script that picks the best choice based on historical data.

Included are 4 json files. 3 with groups of past job candidates (past_candidates1.json, past_candidates2.json, past_candidates3.json) and one with a group of future job candidates (future_candidates.json). Included in the past candidates files are how many interviews they went on and their skills. Included in the future candidates file are their skills. Look at the past candidates to determine which future candidate will likely be going on the most interviews and show us that candidate.

#### How?
* Use PHP, Python or Javascript. Templates for all 3 are provided, pick one.
* The script should be executable on the command line like this ('php prediction.php', 'python prediction.py', 'node prediction.js' )
* Output of the script should be "The candidate with the most interviews should be... [firstname] [lastname]".
* Please include any feedback or comments about this task in your code in the form of a comment block.

#### Why?
This is a very limited data set and a 'correct' result is not as important as you showing us how you write code.
There are many ways to approach this. We know your time is valuable and we don't want you to spend too much time to explore every one. Pick one way of looking at this and explain why you chose that.  Think about developer efficiency, get the best result from the least amount of time coding.

Some things we'll be looking at:
* Is it commented well?
* Is it computationally efficient?
* Was it developer time efficient?
* Does it use best practices?
* Is it easy for another developer to understand?
